In this module we will learn about traces we leave online as we go about our online activities and methods to reduce our footprints.

The recommended teaching format for this module is as follows:

1. Students watch the video lesson either in class or before class.
2. Lecturer guides the students through the hands on activities in class. We have included video instructions and tutorial documents detailing the activities.


Included in this module are:

+ Leaving Traces: Video and lecture slides.
+ VPN Activity: A short video lecture and tutorial document on what a VPN is, and how to use a really simple one. 
+ DNSCrypt: A short video lecture and tutorial document on what DNS is, and how to set up and use a more secure version.
