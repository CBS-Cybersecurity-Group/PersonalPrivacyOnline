In this module we will learn about corporate tracking online.

The recommended teaching format for this module is as follows:

1. (optional) Students read recommended reading list before class.
2. Students watch the video lesson either in class or before class.
3. Lecturer guides the students through the hands on activities he/she selects as time permits. We have included videos and tutorials for these activities as well.


Included in this module are:

+ Product is You: Video and lecture slides.
+ Reading List: Recommended reading list.
+ Light Beam: Tutorial and Video instruction on how to use light beam add-on to identify third party tracking cookies.
+ Cover Your Tracks: Tutorial and Video instruction on using EFF's Cover Your Tracks service to identify what first party information is made available with a simple web site visit.
+ Google Ads: Tutorial and Video instruction on checking out what kind of information Google has on an individual. It is a good exercise demonstrating how seemingly in significant pieces of information observed in Light Beam and Cover Your Tracks activities can be used to build a behavioral profile.
