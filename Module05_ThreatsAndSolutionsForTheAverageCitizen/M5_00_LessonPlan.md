In this module we will learn about common threats an average citizen faces online daily, and a few ways of improving personal security.

The recommended teaching format for this module is as follows:

1. Students watch the video lesson either in class or before class.
2. Lecturer guides the students through the hands on activities he/she selects as time permits. We have included videos and tutorials for these activities as well.


Included in this module are:

+ Common Threats: Video and lecture slides.
+ Password Managers: A short video lecture and tutorial document on what makes a strong password, and how to use a password manager.
+ Multifactor Authentication: A short video lecture and tutorial document on what multifactor authentication is. 
+ Windows Security Settings: A short video lecture and tutorial document on how to access security settings on a Windows computer.
