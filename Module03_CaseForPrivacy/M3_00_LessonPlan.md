In this module we will learn about government surveillance online.

The recommended teaching format for this module is as follows:

1. Students watch the video lesson either in class or before class.
2. Lecturer guides the students through the case study discussion in class. We do not have prior readings for this module, the students will need to read the articles for the case study in the class in the order they are presented.


Included in this module are:

+ The Case for Privacy: Video and lecture slides.
+ The Case for Privacy: Case study. There are two versions one for students and one for lecturers.
